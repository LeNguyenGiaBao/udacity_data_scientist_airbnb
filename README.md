Data Structure:

- `calendar.csv`, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

### Motivation

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. With 2 datasets from 2 different cities, I want to compare each other and to know:

- About position: How is the distribution of price by location and density of hotel?
- About time: How does the month and room occupancy affect hotel prices. Which month has the highest capacity usage and is it a holiday?
- About the host of the hotel: How does the host information affect hotel prices? The higher price whether the host is reputable?

### Project Structure

- `airbnb.ipynb`: analysis code
- `README.md`: introduction, summary about the project

### Result:

I showed in the notebook file with numeric value, chart visualization and my conclusion
